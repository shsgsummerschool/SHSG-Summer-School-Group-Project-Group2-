# SHSG-Summer-School-Group-Project-Group2-

Hi everyone!

We are a group of four dedicated developers who attained the "SHSG Summer School - Introduction to Programming" at the University of St.Gallen. During this course, we developed the sensational App "My Medibox" with Python and SQL. 

The app enables users to scan their medicine with a QR-Code and to create an inventory of their personal home cabinet with the purchase date, expiry date and many more useful informations. You or your doctor can directly check if you already have a medicine at home and therefore do not have to buy it (again). The app notifies you if one of your medicines is expired and how to dispose it safely. Through the usage of the App you can save money and valuable ressources - the days of unnecessary medicine purchase are gone!

In order to run the App on your computer, download the attached Python-File and the SQL database. You are ready to go!

If you have any questions regarding the project or the usage, just drop us an email: shsgsummerschool@gmail.com
